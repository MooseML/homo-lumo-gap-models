# ðŸ§ª HOMOâ€“LUMO Gap Models

A machine learning pipeline for predicting **HOMOâ€“LUMO energy gaps** using 2D and (eventually) 3D molecular features. This repository supports reproducible experiments, model evaluation, and integration with an interactive web app.


### Problem Statement & Motivation

Accurately predicting quantum chemical properties like the HOMOâ€“LUMO gap is essential for advancing materials science, drug discovery, and electronics. The size of the gap offers insight into a molecule's reactivity and stability.

While Density Functional Theory (DFT) provides reliable results, it is computationally expensive for large-scale screening. This project explores machine learning alternatives that are lightweight, interpretable, and feasible to run on modest hardware.

### Related Work & Key Gap

Past research shows:
- DFT is accurate but slow and resource-intensive
- ML models (kernel methods, GNNs) are faster, but can require expensive compute and complex setup

Gap Addressed: This project aims to develop fast, accessible ML models that can serve as a practical alternative to DFT-based gap predictionâ€”scalable for screening pipelines and deployable via a lightweight app.


## Methodology & Evaluation

This repository includes:
- Baseline 2D models using RDKit fingerprints and Coulomb matrices
- Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) using ChemML and OGB-based graph encodings
- A final hybrid GNN model combining structural embeddings and cheminformatics descriptors

| Metric   | Best Model (Hybrid GNN) |
|----------|-------------------------|
| **MAE**  | 0.159 eV                |
| **RMSE** | 0.234 eV                |
| **RÂ²**   | 0.965                   |

Models are evaluated using:
- Parity and residual plots
- MAE, RMSE, RÂ²
- Error inspection on high-error molecules
- Train/val/test splits aligned with OGB standards


## App Deployment

An interactive web application is available for real-time prediction and visualization:
